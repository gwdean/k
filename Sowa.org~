For decades, John Sowa has been one of the leading lights
in the discipline of Knowledge Representation. This document
collects notes on his work.

** Ontology
Sowa's Ontology is described in detail in his book 
/Knowledge Representation/. Page 72 presents the 
top three distinctions in lattice form.

The three distinctions are:
- I/R/M (Independent/Relative/Mediating) 
- P/A   (Physical/Abstract)
- C/O   (Continuant/Occurrent)

Combinations of distinctions:
- IP (Actuality)
- IA (Form)
- RP (Prehension)
- RA (Proposition)
- MP (Nexus)
- MA (Intention)

Three letter concepts
- IPC (Object)
- IPO (Process)
- IAC (Schema)
- IAO (Script)
- RPC (Juncture)
- RPO (Participation)
- RAC (Description)
- RAO (History)
- MPC (Structure)
- MPO (Situation)
- MAC (Reason)
- MAO (Purpose)

The purpose of the ontology is to provide a framework
of distinctions that can be used to discriminate and
classify the things that exist and define the words 
that describe them.

But no fixed collection of distinctions or categories
is likely to be adequate for describing all things 
for all time.
